# DRetinopathy

Hi,

Here you can find some of my previous work on Diabetic Retinopathy Classification. The condition is one of the most common diseases affecting vision and is a
leading cause of blindness in working-age adults. The dataset was obtained from kaggle, augmented and preprocessed using the Augmentor package and turned
to grayscale, it has been linked below:

For any questions, do not hesitate to ask. Diego
